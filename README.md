# Starbucks-clone-mobile-apps
A mobile app for Starbucks, with references from the original Starbucks mobile app where user can select and order from the list of menu.

This project is a part of the bootcamp I enrolled while learning to become a Programmer. And it is created with React Native.

For the database side, I used MongoDb for the customer's database, and PostgreSQL, GraphQL for the products' database.
